In my internship at Ascent Robtoics, I helped develop the next generation of industrial robots using AI. I was solely resposible for the industrial robot arm server that would be responsible for their controls and AI model usage. Some of the interesting problem we solve here was breaking the tradition that robot arms needs to be hard coded to perform a task as they are not 'smart' enough to adapt to object changes by using deep learning and reinforce learning solutions."
